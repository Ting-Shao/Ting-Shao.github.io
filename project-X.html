							<FONT SIZE=7>Introduction</FONT>
								<p>This project use R to visualize data on global electrical power production in 2019, and use shiny to give people an interactive interface to create those visualizations. Different parts of the world tend to generate power in different ways and the application you create here should make it easy for people to see and explore those differences.</p>
								<p>This app has only one dashboard and an about page.</p>
								
							
							
						<FONT SIZE=7>How to run this application</FONT>
							<p>The dashboard initially shows North America and all of the power plants there.</p>
							<p>Each power plant is colored by its fuel type, and has the size of the power plant represent its capacity</p>
							<p>The users are allowed to click on one of the power plants on the map and see additional data about that plant (country name, plant name, capacity, fuel type).</p>
							
							<FONT SIZE=4>Input Control</FONT>
							<p>There are three inputs â€” one select input, one picker input, and one slider input.</p>
							<li>Select input allows the users to choose the continent they want to see.</li>
							<li>Picker input filters the plants by their primary fuel type.</li>
							<li>Slider input sets a capacity range that filters the plants by their capacity .</li>

						<FONT SIZE=4>Entire city of Chicago at the tract level</FONT>
						<p>Compared with the above two pages, in this section, we integrate the data from the census blocks into census tracts and allow the user to show the same data as above at the tract level for the entire City of Chicago.  </p>
						<img src="images/pj3_entire_10.png" alt="pj3_entire_10.png" width="864" height="540" >
						<p>The other new feature is that there is one tab allowing the user to show the 10% census tracts within the entire city with the:
							<li>oldest buildings</li>
							<li>newest building</li>
							<li>tallest buildings</li>
							<li>blocks that use the most electricity over the year</li>
							<li>blocks that use the most gas over the year</li>
							<li>most population</li>
							<li>most occupied percentage</li>
							<li>highest percentage of renters</li>

							<p>
								<FONT SIZE=4>Source</FONT><br>
								The original data is available from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-energy-usage-2010">kaggle</a>.<br>

								and also available at <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Energy-Usage-2010/8yq3-m6wp">Chicago Data Portal</a>.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<FONT SIZE=4>Content</FONT><br>
								Displays several units of energy consumption for households, businesses, and industries in the City of Chicago during 2010. Electric The data was aggregated from ComEd and Peoples Natural Gas by Accenture. Electrical and gas usage data comprises 88 percent of Chicago's buildings in 2010. The electricity data comprises 68 percent of overall electrical usage in the city while gas data comprises 81 percent of all gas consumption in Chicago for 2010.<br>
								<br>
								Census blocks with less than 4 accounts is displayed at the Community Area without further geographic identifiers. This dataset also contains selected variables describing selected characteristics of the Census block population, physical housing, and occupancy.<br>
								
							</p>
							<p>
								In this project, I did not make changes to the data file before loading it into R.

							<FONT SIZE=7>Interesting things I found</FONT>
							<br>
							
							<FONT SIZE=4>1 Electricity and Building stories have a strong connection</FONT>
							<p>
								I use the split visualization to show the building height and electricity simultaneously.<br>
								It is obvious that census blocks with more tall buildings tend to have higher electricity usage<br>
							</p>
							<img src="images/pj3_i_EandB.png" alt="" width="864" height="540" ><br>
						
							<FONT SIZE=4>2 10% census tracts </FONT>
							<p>
								Focus on 10% census tracts for the entire Chicago City, I found that:<br>
								
								The blocks in the city center have several characteristics:
								<li>Higher average stories of building</li>
								<img src="images/pj3_i_tallestbuilding.png" alt="" width="864" height="540" ><br>
								<li>Higher population density</li>
								<img src="images/pj3_i_mostpopulation.png" alt="" width="864" height="540" ><br>
								<li>Lower building age </li>
								<img src="images/pj3_i_newestbuilding.png" alt="" width="864" height="540" ><br>
								
								Tracts with high occupied percentage of housing units and tracts with high percentage of occupied housing units that are renters are geographically dispersed.<br> 
								They may not have much to do with the regionality.<br>
